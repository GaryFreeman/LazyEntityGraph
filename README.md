# LazyEntityGraph
LazyEntityGraph is the successor to [AutoEntityFramework](/alexfoxgill/AutoFixture.AutoEntityFramework). This project aims to both improve upon the functionality of the original, and open the door to integration with other test object creators.

## Objective
When writing tests, we often need to create test objects without necessarily caring about the data that's used to populate them.
